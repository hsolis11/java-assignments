<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view at the Orientation link in your Blackboard course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and&nbsp;make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your assignment.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this assignment. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the assignment. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<center>
<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.<h2 class="auto-style1">Source Code and Class Files</h2>

<p>You will find a source code file for the driver class (named Proj04.java) for the program 
in the same zip file from which you extracted this project specification.</p>
<p>You will also find compiled class files for my version of the program in that 
same zip file. Run my version of the program side-by-side with your version and 
compare your output with my output to make sure they match before submitting 
your assignment.</p>

<center>
<h2>Java Version Requirement</h2>
</center>

<p>Software version requirements are specified in the syllabus for this course.</p>

<div class="a">
<p>Proj04 Copyright 2020 R.G.Baldwin</p>
<p>Among other things, the purpose of this assignment is to assess the student's 
ability to write a program dealing with sorting, arrays, and collections.</p>
	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Beginning with the file that you downloaded named <strong>Proj04.java</strong>, create a new file named <strong>
		Proj04Runner.java</strong> to meet the specifications 
		given below.</p>
	  <p>Note that you must not modify the code in the file named <strong>Proj04.java</strong>.</p>
	  <p>Be sure to display your name in the output as indicated.</p>
	<p>When you place both files in the same folder, compile them both, and run the file 
	named <strong>Proj04.java</strong> <em> <strong class="auto-style2">with a 
	command-line argument of 6</strong></em>, the program must display the text shown below on the 
	command line screen. </p>

	<p>Your output text must match my output text for a command-line argument 
	of any numeric value that you choose. Run your program and my program side by side with 
	different command-line-arguments to 
	confirm that they match before submitting your program. For example, the 
	following text shows the output text created by running my program six 
	times in succession for command-line argument values of 1 through 6 
	respectively. (Note 
	that I deleted the certification text from each output to conserve space.)</p>

	<p>When you place both files in the same folder, compile them both, and run the file 
	named <strong>Proj04.java</strong> <strong class="auto-style2"><em>without a 
	command-line argument</em></strong>, the program must display text that is 
	similar to, but not necessarily the same as the text shown below on the 
	command line screen. In this case, the input names are based on a random 
	number generator that will change from one run to the next because the seed 
	is based on the date and time.</p>
