<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view at the Orientation link in your Blackboard course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your assignment.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this assignment. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the assignment. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<center>
<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.<h2 class="auto-style1">Source Code and Class Files</h2>

<p>You will find a source code file for the driver class (named Proj06.java) for the program 
in the same zip file from which you extracted this project specification.</p>
<p>You will also find compiled class files for my version of the program in that 
same zip file. Run my version of the program side-by-side with your version and 
compare your output with my output to make sure they match before submitting 
your assignment.</p>

<center>
<h2>Java Version Requirement</h2>
</center>

<p>Software version requirements are specified in the syllabus for this course.</p>

<div class="a">
<p>Proj06 Copyright 2020 R.G.Baldwin</p>
<p>Among other things, the purpose of this assignment is to assess the student's 
ability to write a program dealing with window events, mouse events, and the 
Delegation Event Model.</p>
	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Beginning with the file that you downloaded named <strong>Proj06.java</strong>, create a new file named <strong>
		Proj06Runner.java</strong> to meet the specifications 
		given below.</p>
	  <p>Note that you must not modify the code in the file named <strong>Proj06.java</strong>.</p>
	  <p>Be sure to display your name in both locations in the output as indicated.</p>
	<p>When you place both files in the same folder, compile them both, and run the file 
	named <strong>Proj06.java</strong>, the program must display the text shown below on the 
	command line screen. </p>
<div class="a">
<pre>
I certify that this program is my own work
and is not the work of others. I agree not
to share my solution with others.
Replace this line with your name
</pre>
</div>





	<p>In addition, your program must display a single 300-pixel by 100-pixel 
	<strong>Frame</strong> object as shown in the images below. When you click the mouse in the 
	working area of the <strong>Frame</strong>, the coordinates of the mouse pointer must be shown in
	<span class="auto-style2">RED</span> above the mouse pointer. <em>(Multiple images are shown below 
	to show the result of clicking at different locations in the working 
	area of the <strong>Frame</strong>. Note that the 0,0 coordinate location is at the outer upper-left corner of the 
	<strong>Frame</strong>, which is beyond the reach of the mouse 
	pointer.)</em></p>
	<p>When you click the X-button in the upper-right corner of the <strong>Frame</strong> 
	object, the program must terminate and MUST RETURN CONTROL TO THE OPERATING 
	SYSTEM.</p>
	<p>You may find it necessary to consult the Java documentation and take 
	class inheritance into account to meet these specifications.</p>
