Illustrates the use of Event Sources, Event Listeners, and
Adapters in the Delegation Event Model.

Briefly, this application instantiates an object which
creates a user interface consisting of a simple Frame
object.  This object is an Event Source which notifies two
different Event Listener objects of Window events.

One of the Listener objects implements the WindowListener
interface and overrides all of the methods declared in
that interface.

The other Listener object extends the Adapter class named
WindowAdapter.  The purpose of Adapter classes is to
implement the  Listener interfaces and to define all of
the methods with empty methods.  Classes which extend the
Adapter classes can then selectively override only those
methods of interest.  This Listener object overrides only
two of the methods.

Note that this application does not terminate and return
control to the operating system.  You must forcefully
terminate it.

This program was tested using JDK 1.1.3 under Win95.

When executed, this application places a simple empty
Frame object on the screen.

Starting the program produces the following output:
WProc1 windowActivated test msg
Wproc1 windowOpened test msg

Pressing the minimize button on the Frame produces the
following output:

WProc1 windowIconified test msg
******** WProc2 windowIconified test msg
WProc1 windowDeactivated test msg

Restoring the Frame after minimization produces the
following output:

WProc1 windowActivated test msg
WProc1 windowDeiconified test msg
******** WProc2 windowDeiconified test msg
WProc1 windowActivated test msg

Closing the Frame by pressing the X-icon in the upper
right of the Frame produces the following output.

WProc1 windowClosing test msg
WProc1 windowDeactivated test msg
WProc1 windowClosed test msg
