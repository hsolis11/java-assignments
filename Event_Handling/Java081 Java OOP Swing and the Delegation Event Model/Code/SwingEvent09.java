This is a Swing version of the program named Event09.

The purpose of this program is to illustrate that in some
cases, conversion of an AWT program to a Swing program
isn't as simple as importing the Swing package and replacing
the AWT components with Swing components.

That is what was done with this program.  In other words,
this program is identical to the AWT program named Event09
except that all instances of Frame were replaced by JFrame
and the Swing package was imported.

At the surface, the program appears to work correctly.
However, as each new click occurs on the client area of
the JFrame, a new pair of coordinate values is displayed,
but the previous pairs of coordinate values don't disappear
as is the case with the program named Event09.

Furthermore, in some cases, while this GUI is on the screen,
if focus is transferred to a different application, all of
the coordinate values except the last one created will;
disappear.

It will be left as an exercise for the student to dig into
the (currently very sparse) documentation on Swing in order
to understand and explain this behavior.

Illustrates the use of Event Sources, Event Listeners, and;
Adapters in the Delegation Event Model for Swing.

This program instantiates a Listener object to process;
mouse events. When a mouse press occurs in a JFrame object,
the program gets the coordinates and then displays those
coordinates near the point of the mouse press.

Tested using JDK 1.1.6 and Swing 1.0.1 under Win95.
