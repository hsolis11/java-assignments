/*File Event23.java Copyright 1997, R.G.Baldwin
Revised 9/17/97
This program is designed to be compiled and run under 
JDK 1.1

The program illustrates the use of Inner Classes with event 
handling under the JDK 1.1 Delegation Event Handling model.

The controlling class is named Event23.  An Inner Class 
named GUI is defined inside the class named Event23 and an
object of that class is instantiated inside the main() 
method.

In addition, two "data processing" methods named sing() and
whistle() are defined inside the controlling class.  They 
are defined in such a way as to be separated from the event
handling activity except that they are invoked by the event
handler methods.

Three more Inner Classes are defined inside the Inner Class
named GUI. They are named SingActionListener, 
WhistleActionListener, and Terminator.  All three of these 
are Listener classes.  The first two implement the 
ActionListener interface while the third extends the
WindowListener adapter.

The first two override the actionPerformed() method of the 
ActionListener interface while the third overrides the 
windowClosing() method of the WindowListener interface.

The class named GUI extends Frame.  Two Button objects 
labeled Sing and Whistle are instantiated in the GUI 
constructor. They are referenced by variables named 
singButton and whistleButton respectively.  Both buttons
are added to the Frame object.

Anonymous Listener objects of the classes 
SingActionListener and WhistleActionListener are 
instantiated and registered for event handling on the two 
Button objects having similar names.

An anonymous Listener object of the class Terminator is 
registered for event handling on the Frame object of class 
GUI.

When the program starts, a Frame object containing the two 
buttons appears on the screen.  When the user clicks on the
button labeled Sing, the event handler registered to 
listen for Action events on that button invokes the method 
named sing() causing the message

"I am singing, Tra la la" 

to be displayed on the screen.

When the user clicks ont the button labeled Whistle, the 
event handler registered to listen for Action events on 
that button invokes the method named whistle() causing the 
message 

"I am whistling, Tweet, Tweet, Tweet"

to be displayed on the screen.

When the user clicks the "close" box on the Frame, the 
event handler registered to listen for windowClosing() 
events on the Frame terminates the program.

This version uses long form notation as opposed to the use
of anonymous inner classes.  See the program named Event22 
for a version that uses the more cryptic abbreviated 
notation attributable to the use of anonymous inner 
classes.

These results were produced using JDK 1.1 running under 
Windows 95.
