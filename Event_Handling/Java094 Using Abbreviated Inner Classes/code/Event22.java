/*File Event22.java Copyright 1997, R.G.Baldwin
Revised 9/17/97
This program is designed to be compiled and run under 
JDK 1.1

The program illustrates the use of Inner Classes with event 
handling under the JDK 1.1 Delegation Event Handling model.

The use of anonymous Inner Classes is also illustrated.
See the program named Event23 for an example of Inner
Classes that does not use anonymous Inner Classes.

The controlling class is named Event22.  An Inner Class 
named GUI is defined inside the class named Event22 and an 
object of that class is instantiated inside the main() 
method.

In addition, two "data processing" methods named sing() and
whistle() are defined inside the controlling class named
Event22.  They are defined in such a way as to be separated
from the event handling activity except that they are 
invoked by the event handler methods.

Abbreviated notation is used to anonymously define the 
classes for and instantiate three anonymous listener 
objects inside the Inner Class named GUI. The first two 
implement the ActionListener interface while the third 
extends the WindowListener adapter.

The first two implement the actionPerformed() method of the
ActionListener interface while the third overrides the 
windowClosing() method of the WindowListener interface.

The class named GUI extends Frame.  Two Button objects 
labeled Sing and Whistle are instantiated in the GUI 
constructor. They are referenced by variables named 
singButton and whistleButton respectively.  Both buttons
are added to the Frame object.

The first two anonymous listener objects mentioned above 
are registered to listen for actionPerformed() events on 
the two buttons respectively.  The third anonymous listener
object is registered to listen for windowClosing() events 
on the Frame object.

When the program starts, a Frame object containing the two 
buttons appears on the screen.  When the user clicks on the
button labeled Sing, the event handler registered to listen
for Action events on that button invokes the method named 
sing() causing the message

"I am singing, Tra la la" 

to be displayed on the screen.

When the user clicks one the button labeled Whistle, the 
event handler registered to listen for Action events on 
that button invokes the method named whistle() causing the 
message 

"I am whistling, Tweet, Tweet, Tweet"

to be displayed on the screen.

When the user clicks the "close" box on the Frame, the 
event handler registered to listen for windowClosing() 
events on the Frame terminates the program.

This version of the program uses abbreviated notation to 
define anonymous classes and instantiate anonymous listener
objects.  The abbreviated notation is fairly cryptic.  See 
the program named Event23 for a version that does the same 
thing without using the abbreviated notation.

These results were produced using JDK 1.1 running under 
Windows 95.
