/*File Callback02.java Copyright 1997, R.G.Baldwin
The purpose of this program is to develop a callback
capability using Interfaces.  

This is an enhanced version of the program named 
Callback01. You should familiarize yourself with
the earlier program before getting into this program.

This version has the added capability to create and 
maintain a list of objects that register for callback
whereas the program named Callback01 could only remember
a single object for callback.

In addition, this version defines two different classes 
that implement the CallBack interface.  Mixed objects
of those two types are maintained on the list and
notified at CallBack time.

As before, this program defines a CallBack interface 
that can be used to establish a new type of object, and 
also to declare the interface to a method named callBack() 
that is contained in all objects of classes that
implement the interface.  This method can be used to 
notify those objects whenever something interesting 
happens.

The program defines a Teacher class that has the 
ability to create and maintain a list of objects
of the interface type, and to notify those objects
that something interesting has happened by invoking
the callBack() method on all the objects on the list.

The size of the list is limited only to the largest Vector
object that can be accommodated by the system.

The program defines a class named Student that 
implements the CallBack interface.  It also defines
a class named Dog that implements the CallBack
interface.

Objects of the Student and Dog classes can be registered 
on the list maintained by an object of the Teacher class,
and can be notified by the object of the Teacher class 
whenever something interesting happens. 

Note that objects can be added to the list and then
removed from the list.  One object is first added
and later removed for demonstration purposes.

Notification takes the form of invoking the
callBack() method on all the objects on the list.

The body of the callBack() methods in the classes that
implement the interface can be designed to do anything.
In this case, to keep things simple, they just announces
that they have been called.  However, they make the 
announcement in slightly different ways.

This program contains System.out.println() statements in
the registration and notification methods for 
demonstration purposes only, and to allow us to track
what is happening as the program runs.

Finally, the program defines a controlling class that
ties all the pieces together and exercises them.

Tested using JDK 1.1.3 under Win95.

The output from the program was:

Register Tom
Student@1cc73e added
Register Spot
Dog@1cc74e added
Register Sue
Student@1cc741 added
Register Fido
Dog@1cc751 added
Register Peg
Student@1cc744 added
Register Bob
Student@1cc747 added
Register Brownie
Dog@1cc754 added
Remove Peg
Student@1cc744 removed
Try to remove Joe
Student@1cc74a not in the list

Tom here
Woof, Woof Spot
Sue here
Woof, Woof Fido
Bob here
Woof, Woof Brownie
  
Note that Peg didn't appear in the callBack list because
she was first added to, and later removed from the list.
